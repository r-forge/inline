This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-inline package of inline which
providesng support for 'inlining' functions written in Fortran, C or
C++ into R, and which was written by Oleg Sklyar with contributions by
Duncan Murdoch, Mike Smith and Dirk Eddelbuettel.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the CRAN network at
	http://cran.r-project.org

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'inline' to
'r-cran-inline' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.
